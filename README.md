## How it Works
This program asks the user to type in their name, and any word of their choosing.
Then, it displays their name, along with how many characters were in the word they entered.

## Installation and Usage
1. First, install Jupyter. Directions can be found [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/master/README.md)
2. Then, clone this repository using this command `git clone https://github.com/JMB446/Group-Project.git`
3. Open the python notebook, and execute the code cell, typing in your name when prompted, and the other word when prompted.
4. Done!

We chose the GNU Affero GPL as our license and the Contributor Covenant as our CoC. Both the license and the CoC are reasonable in their
terms, while enforcing certain boundaries/allowances. We considered going with the Unlicense instead, but it seemed too lenient for our likes.
The Contributor Covenant overall, outlines how kind basic human interaction should occur. It can almost be seen as common sense, but outlines
specifics in case there are any grey areas as to what is allowed.
